## 👋 Who Am I?

I'm **Arul Nova**, a developer who believes that great code isn't just about making things work—it's about making them work *elegantly*. Based in India, I make sure to hit the sweet spot between *minimalistic design* and *creative functionality*. I am a quick learner with an insatiable curiosity for technology, constantly evolving my skill set and pushing the boundaries of what I can build. Currently exploring freelancing opportunities where I can bring creative ideas to life and collaborate with people who value quality craftsmanship as much as I do.

## 🎯 Featured Project

**Kael - Discord Bot** — Built purely with JavaScript and MongoDB, Kael isn't just another Discord bot. It's a comprehensive solution crafted from the ground up to handle moderation, entertainment, utility, and everything in between. Every feature, every command, every interaction was coded with performance and user experience in mind.

## 💼 Let's Work Together!

**What I Bring:**
- Lightning-fast learning curve (seriously, try me)
- Minimalistic design philosophy meets functional creativity
- Full-stack capabilities with JavaScript and Python
- A genuine passion for building things that matter
